IMPORTANT Installation Instructions
====================================


RXTX Serial Driver Install
--------------------------
In order to complete the install, you will need to download and install two files:
	rxtxSerial.dll
	RXTXcomm.jar

These files can be found in a zip file from: http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Download

Extract the two files from the zip and put them in your Quiz Box directory with the other
program files.

The reason that I did not include these files is that the actual files you will download
depend on the version of Windows that you have and if it is 64 bit or 32 bit.  Make sure
that you get the correct version.
